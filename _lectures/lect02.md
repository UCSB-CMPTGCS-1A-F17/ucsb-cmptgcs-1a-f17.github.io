In this lecture, first Phill did an "overview of the territory" of CMPTGCS 1A, which covers material from three CoE CS courses:

* CMPSC 16
* CMPSC 24
* CMPSC 32

Here's the image we drew:

Then we worked on the labs.  Each student should do CS16_lab00 to make
sure their accounts are working, then should either continue through
CS16_lab01, etc in order, or skip ahead to whatever place in the
sequence provides them with an appropriate learning challenge.
