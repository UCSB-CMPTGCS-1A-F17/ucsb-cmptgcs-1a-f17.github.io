In this first session, we first discussed how the goals of CMPTGCS 1A, namely:

* To prepare students for CMPSC&nbsp;130A, other upper division coursework, and research in Computer Science, by...
* Providing an accelerated path through the course material of CMPSC&nbsp;16, CMPSC&nbsp;24 and CMPSC&nbsp;32 
    (which go by CS16, CS24 and CS32 for short.)
    
We also discussed, more generally:
* the structure of the CCS Computing curriculum
* the roles of CMPTGCS 1A, 1B, 1L and 2 
* how those courses map on to the CMPSC 8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64 sequence of courses that they replace (at triple speed.)

We discussed the goal of building a learning community, and made reference to this [New York Times article about what
Google found about successful teams](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=0).

We also began a discussion of git, github.com and github.ucsb.edu.  Some of that material can be found in these articles:

The assignment was for each student to look through the two textbooks for the course, which collectively are the textbooks for the CS16,24,32 sequence, and find their individual "starting point".
