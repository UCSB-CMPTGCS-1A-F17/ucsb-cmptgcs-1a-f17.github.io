Tool chain for C/C++

* git/github
* Github Organization: <https://github.com/ucsb-cmptgcs-1a-f17>
    * All enrolled students in CMPTGCS 1A for Fall 2017 have been enrolled in this organization
    * That gives you the ability to create repos "owned" by the organization, instead of you.
    * Creating repos under this organization, instead of your personal account has some benefits:
        * Your instructor, and any helpers for the class (mentors, TAs, etc.) automatically have access
        * Doesn't count as a private repo against your own account's limit (if/when you lose your "student discount" of unlimited repos, no problem.)
        * Doesn't clutter up your personal github space.
* Hello World programs in C and C++
* editors and IDEs
    * Old School editors.  
         * examples: [emacs](https://ucsb-cs16.github.io/topics/emacs/), [vi/vim](https://ucsb-cs16.github.io/topics/vim/)
    * Full on IDEs. 
         * examples: [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/), [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/), [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
    * Middle ground: 
         * examples: [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
* gcc, clang, g++ and clang++ compilers
* make and Makefiles
* various kinds of files: `.c`, `.h`, `.cpp`, `.hpp`, `.o`, executable
* debugger: gdb


# Creating your account on submit.cs

1. Go to https://submit.cs.ucsb.edu
2. Click "Create Account".
3. Use your @umail.ucsb.edu account to create your account.
4. Then, login at https://submit.cs.ucsb.edu
5. Click "Join Class", and find the button "Join CMPTGCS_1a_f16". Click it.

# Logging into CSIL from a terminal prompt (for simple command line stuff without graphics)

These instructions work at the following terminal prompts:
* Mac OS
    * Terminal
* Linux (also any other reasonable Unix-based system)
    * Any terminal/shell 
* Windows
    * the "git bash shell" provided by [git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
    * shells provided by [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)
    * The Microsoft provided [bash for Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about) (on Windows 10, and we assume, subsequent versions of Windows)

Assuming your CSIL username is cgaucho, use:

```
ssh cgaucho@csil-07.cs.ucsb.edu
```

BUT: `csil-07` should not be taken literally.  Use any of `csil-01`, `csil-02`, `csil-03`, etc. through `csil-48`.

# Other ways to connect (simple command line without graphics)

* PuTTY on Windows.  Hostname is csil-01.cs.ucsb.edu (or any of 01 through 48).

# Connecting with X11 Graphics

* On MacOS:
    * You need an extra download, XQuartz
    * Then, just use "ssh -Y ..." instead of "ssh"
* On Unix/Linux:
    * Just using "ssh -Y ... " instead of "ssh" should work.
* On Windows:
    * Easiest known free solution: MobaXTerm (usually just "works")
    * Another known free solution: PuTTY + XMing  (requires a bit of configuration)
    * X11 server built into Cygwin


# Useful Unix Commands

* Make a whole directory path at once:
    ```
    mkdir -p foo/bar/fum/fiddle
    ```
    
*   Remote secure copy (via "scp", a cousin of "ssh", the "secure shell") a file from CSIL to current directory
    on your local machine
    ```
    scp yourusername@csil-01.cs.ucsb.edu:/some/directory/on/csil/some_file.cpp .
    ```
    
*   Scp files with a wildcard, e.g. `*.cpp`.
    Note that you have to "escape" the wildcard, so that it gets interpreted on the remote system instead of at
    the local shell.
    
    ```
    scp yourusername@csil-01.cs.ucsb.edu:/some/directory/on/csil/\*.cpp .
    ```

    
*   Scp entire directory.
    Note that you have to "escape" the wildcard, so that it gets interpreted on the remote system instead of at
    the local shell.
    
    ```
    scp -r yourusername@csil-01.cs.ucsb.edu:/some/directory/on/csil .
    ```

# Test-Driven Development in C++

Google Test and Google Mock are frameworks that support test-driven development in C++.
