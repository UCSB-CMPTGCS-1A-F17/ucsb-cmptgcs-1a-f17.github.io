Tool chain for C/C++

* git/github
* Github Organization: [https://github.com/UCSB-CMPTGCS-1A-F16](https://github.com/UCSB-CMPTGCS-1A-F16)
    * All enrolled students in CMPTGCS 1A for Fall 2016 have been enrolled in this organization
    * That gives you the ability to create repos "owned" by the organization, instead of you.
    * Creating repos under this organization, instead of your personal account has some benefits:
        * Your instructor, and any helpers for the class (mentors, TAs, etc.) automatically have access
        * Doesn't count as a private repo against your own account's limit (if/when you lose your "student discount" of unlimited repos, no problem.)
        * Doesn't clutter up your personal github space.
* Hello World programs in C and C++
* editors and IDEs
    * Old School editors.  
         * examples: [emacs](https://ucsb-cs16.github.io/topics/emacs/), [vi/vim](https://ucsb-cs16.github.io/topics/vim/)
    * Full on IDEs. 
         * examples: [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/), [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/), [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
    * Middle ground: 
         * examples: [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
* gcc, clang, g++ and clang++ compilers
* make and Makefiles
* various kinds of files: `.c`, `.h`, `.cpp`, `.hpp`, `.o`, executable
* debugger: gdb
