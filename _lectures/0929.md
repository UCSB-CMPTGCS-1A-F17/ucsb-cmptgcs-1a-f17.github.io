# Logging into CSIL from a terminal prompt (for simple command line stuff without graphics)

These instructions work at the following terminal prompts:
* Mac OS
    * Terminal
* Linux (also any other reasonable Unix-based system)
    * Any terminal/shell 
* Windows
    * the "git bash shell" provided by [git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
    * shells provided by [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)
    * The Microsoft provided [bash for Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about) (on Windows 10, and we assume, subsequent versions of Windows)

Assuming your CSIL username is cgaucho, use:

```
ssh cgaucho@csil-07.cs.ucsb.edu
```

BUT: `csil-07` should not be taken literally.  Use any of `csil-01`, `csil-02`, `csil-03`, etc. through `csil-48`.

# Other ways to connect (simple command line without graphics)

* PuTTY on Windows.  Hostname is csil-01.cs.ucsb.edu (or any of 01 through 48).

# Connecting with X11 Graphics

* On MacOS:
    * You need an extra download, XQuartz
    * Then, just use "ssh -Y ..." instead of "ssh"
* On Unix/Linux:
    * Just using "ssh -Y ... " instead of "ssh" should work.
* On Windows:
    * Easiest known free solution: MobaXTerm (usually just "works")
    * Another known free solution: PuTTY + XMing  (requires a bit of configuration)
    * X11 server built into Cygwin


# Useful Unix Commands

* Make a whole directory path at once:
    ```
    mkdir -p foo/bar/fum/fiddle
    ```
    
*   Remote secure copy (via "scp", a cousin of "ssh", the "secure shell") a file from CSIL to current directory
    on your local machine
    ```
    scp yourusername@csil-01.cs.ucsb.edu:/some/directory/on/csil/some_file.cpp .
    
*   Scp files with a wildcard, e.g. `*.cpp`.
    Note that you have to "escape" the wildcard, so that it gets interpreted on the remote system instead of at
    the local shell.
    
    ```
    scp yourusername@csil-01.cs.ucsb.edu:/some/directory/on/csil/\*.cpp .
    ```
